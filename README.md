Update 9-oct-2020!
I know that it's probably pretty much only myself that ever used this project, however, for what it's worth, I updated the code recently and moved it to a different repo here - https://github.com/galkahana/hummus-reports. switched to JS base BIDI algo, which allows to finally work with this on PC, and really simplified matters. for what it's worth it's now my tool of choice when looking to create PDF reports.
